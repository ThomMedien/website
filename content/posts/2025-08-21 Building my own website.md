Building my own website, News Global, began as a personal challenge. I wanted to dive into a new world of code and truly understand the core principles of UI/UX and web design. The idea was simple enough: centralise news from different countries onto an interactive map. It was a perfect project for a hands-on learning approach.

The development was a continuous process of learning and problem-solving. While I had wanted to master everything myself, I hit a wall with the coding. This is where the project became heavily reliant on AI, which took over the elements I didn't know as much about. It helped me bridge the gap in my knowledge, building components and handling the backend while I focused on understanding the code it was generating.

As a completely solo project, I've hit a unique challenge: knowing when to stop. There's no client to sign off on the final design, no deadline pushing the last feature. Every day, I find a new detail to polish, a new way to improve the user interface, or a new piece of code to refine. The hardest part of building your own website, Iâ€™ve found, is accepting that you might never be truly "done." Instead, it's about getting to a point where it's ready to share, understanding that it's a living project that will always evolve.
