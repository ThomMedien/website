Making a career change is tough. Moving from media design and photography into the digital world felt overwhelming, especially when it came to building a new portfolio. A quick Google search brings up a massive variety of AI platforms, with countless new software options promising to design my site for me. I spent more time trying to figure out which tool to use than actually building anything.

The reality was that all those complex AI tools made things more confusing; they didn't feel personal. What actually worked for me were simple, traditional methods. I got the most value from doing my own research, looking at how other designers tell their stories, and sketching ideas down on paper, even if my sketches were far from visually appealing.

Don't get me wrong, while primitive methods are great for initial conceptualization, tools like Miro and Figma become **absolutely necessary** at a certain point. For me, once a solid idea was formed, they were essential for building out detailed wireframes, prototypes, and a cohesive design system. One video in particular, which you can find here, really helped me cut through the noise: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuhJXZ6txt4&t=1980s).

I realized my unique background in media and photography is what makes my work originalâ€”not an AI. I can use AI to help me visualize my ideas with code, but for now, the human brain is still superior when it comes to conceptualization.
