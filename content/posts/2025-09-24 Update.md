Quick check-in on what Ive been up to lately.

Ive been learning n8n to automate repetitive tasksexperimenting with workflows for content updates, notifications, and simple data transforms. Its already cutting out a lot of manual glue work.

Im also exploring MCP (Model Context Protocol) to connect assistants with real tools. The goal is to make actions like pulling Figma components, publishing Webflow updates, or assembling briefs happen from one placesafely and with context.

On the portfolio side, Im shaping case studies: clarifying before/after states, decisions, and impact. Ive been sketching website concepts to better support those narratives, focusing on clarity, speed, and strong visual hierarchy.

Next up: tighten the case study drafts, wire up a couple of n8n flows end-to-end, and try an MCP-powered design-to-web flow to reduce handoff time.
